msgText:a question from anothe topic:  #3 of 3: $1500 Rebate/Incentive (Zapata) Mon 24 Nov '97 (12:58 PM)   Did no my homework and found out $1500 on  both customer rebate and dealer incentive.  Dealer said no way Jose, only applicble to the BASIC T100! To me 'BASIC" measn frame and four wheels.  Kelly Blue Book only has $500 customer rebate.  This is for the Toyota T100 4wd, 5sp, 6 cy, SR5.  Who is right?  Dealer or Edmunds or Kelly, which is it? Is $1000 over dealer invoice to much, (intent for the $1000 to cover DH, advertising etc).   Dealer Holdback 2% of base invoice means exactly what?

msgText:After reading Edmunds article on dealer holdbacks, I had the understanding that the dealer holdback fee was included in the invoice price.  I am shopping for a new Mitsubishi Eclipse.  I had a dealer fax me the invoice so I could see the extra fees he was telling me about.  After listing the base invoice price and the invoice price on all the options, they listed some additional fees:  sales promotion fund         $100 dealer advertising assn.     $382 holdback                     $439 dealer flooring assistance   $220  These fees were added to the invoice price.  Then they added 3% on top of that.  Is this normal??

msgText:Mitsubishi is the one make that charges the consumer DIRECTLY the holdback amount.  Or rather, Mitsubishi allows their dealers to charge this instead of the normal "invisible" holdback.  You do not have to pay this amount, just as you can dispute the percentage when shopping other makes.  It is normal for Mitsubishi dealers to charge it, however, and whether or not they'll drop the charge is up to the individual dealer (and whether or not you'll still buy the car).

msgText:I'd like to know who you are dealing with because I have never heard of a dealer releasing invoice prices in print!  How does their invoice price compare to Edmunds figure?  Is it accurate? The holdback IS included in the invoice price.  In other words, if the dealer sold the car at invoice, they make the holdback as profit.  And, it is not a "fee", it is a kickback from the manufacturer.  I have never heard of the "holdback fee" they are trying to charge you.  Anyone else? May I assume the 3% is the "reasonable" profit they want to make?  Well, why should you pay a profit on the advertising charge? It probably has profit built in.  And why 2 advertising charges?  Are they both legitimate costs?  Does anyone know? Lastly, what is flooring assistance?

msgText:Hate to disagree with you, Guitarzan, but, as I just said, Mitsubishi does things a little differently.  Holdback is printed right on the invoice, and everything Niemeyer5 says sounds typical.  Expect to pay 1-3% extra in these kind of charges.  Advertising fees are usually always non-negotiable.  And flooring assistance?  That allows the dealer to have some models on hand at the dealership.  (They gotta' pay rent, too.)  You can try to argue about each of the charges, but the only one they might (and should) drop is the holdback.

msgText:If a dealer does not have the Chev. Blazer that I want,does a search and finds it at another dealer, which dealer received the holdback? Can I subtract all of the holdback or just a portion of it from invoice to determine dealer cost?  What kind of fees should I expect for the dealer going to pick up the Blazer?

msgText:I just visited a dealer and was given the invoice and the numbers matched the Edmunds numbers - and he offered to sell at the invoice price. So, that means they make the 3% holdback, right?  Then on the trade - I used Edmund's figures on my 90 Accord EX manual trans. without ABS & leather but with everything else including a phone with 157,000 miles and came up with $2700 and he offered me $2000.  He said in order to get my business he may be able to add some accessories but that's about it.  I think we're $700 off, am I right?  Going back tomorrow.

msgText:I'm being told by my local Honda salesperson that there is no 2% holdback for Canada. Can anyone verify this? There certainly are holdbacks for the big 3. I'm rather skeptical of this claim. He also says that Honda works from a 7% margin, not 5%. Needless to say, I've already started looking for quotes elsewhere but am curious about the 2% holdback issue.  BTW, adding 40% to U.S. MSRP for the CRV works out very close to the advertised CDN price.

msgText:To liang,  Re: is this a good deal?  Your calcultations seem correct. Keep in mind that dealers are more wiiling to deal especiallty towards the end of the year. Double check your figures and the car buying tips from Edmunds and if everything matches up, buy the car for the lower price. By the way, I bought a 97 Accord at invoice, basically 2.5%. They profited the dealer holdback but i was able to "pass" the destination and handling charge to them. Helps if you are informed.

msgText:Is it true, that the dealer inv. price for the base model of a 1/2 ton truck already includes the destination charges & adv. or FDAF assessment.  If they add it on top of the dealer inv. price it is pure profit to them!

msgText:I have seen a 'regional' promotion rebate from Toyota- a $500 coupon for purchasing 1998 Toyota new cars (valid until 1/5/98). I found it from  , clicked on the 'dealer services', then used the 'dealer locator' to check my local dealer information. This special program I found so far covers most of the west PA. You can check if it is good at your area. Good luck!

msgText:There are some dealer's in my area who call themselves "high volume/discount" dealers.  I assume that this means that they pay Honda, etc. less than the invoice price for the cars on their lots.  Is this actually another "figure" that I should factor into my bid, or are they just monkeying around with the other values that services like Edmund's reports on (eg. holdback, rebate, etc.)?  If this is another separate discount, how can I determine its amount?  Any ideas??
